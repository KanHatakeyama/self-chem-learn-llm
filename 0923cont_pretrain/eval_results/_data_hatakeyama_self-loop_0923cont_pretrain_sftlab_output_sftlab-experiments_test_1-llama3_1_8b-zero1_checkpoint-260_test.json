This value indicates that the compound is relatively dense, likely due to the presence of the heavy metal ion, iron (Fe), in its structure. The high density of the compound can be attributed to the high atomic mass of iron, which contributes significantly to the overall mass of the molecule.\n\nThe presence of potassium ions (K+) also contributes to the density of the compound, as they are relatively heavy. However, the effect of the potassium ions is less significant compared to the iron ion, as they have a lower atomic mass.\n\nThe cyanide groups ([C]#N) in the compound also contribute to its density, but to a lesser extent compared to the metal ions. The cyanide groups are relatively light and do not significantly affect the overall density of the compound.\n\nOverall, the high density of the compound is primarily due to the presence of the iron ion, which has a significant impact on the overall mass of the molecule. The potassium ions and cyanide groups also contribute to the density, but to a lesser extent."
