This value is within the typical range for organic compounds, which usually have densities between 0.8 and 1.5 [g/cm3]. The relatively high density of 2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid can be attributed to the presence of two carboxylic acid groups, which contribute to the overall molecular weight and density of the compound. \n\n#Prediction: 1.35 [g/cm3]"

    "predicted_text": "The compound with the given SMILES notation CC1=C(C=CC(=C1)OP(=S)(OC)OC)SC has a predicted density of 1.1 [g/cm3]. This value indicates that the compound is slightly denser than water, which has a density of 1 [g/cm3] at standard conditions. The presence of sulfur and phosphorus atoms in the compound may contribute to its relatively high density due to their atomic masses. However, without knowing the exact molecular structure or the compound's name, it is difficult to provide a more detailed explanation for this value. Further analysis of the compound's molecular structure and properties would be necessary to fully understand its density. \n\n#Prediction: 1.1 [g/cm3] \n#Reason: The compound's density is slightly higher than that of water, likely due to the presence of sulfur and phosphorus atoms. However, more information about the compound's structure is needed for a more detailed explanation."
