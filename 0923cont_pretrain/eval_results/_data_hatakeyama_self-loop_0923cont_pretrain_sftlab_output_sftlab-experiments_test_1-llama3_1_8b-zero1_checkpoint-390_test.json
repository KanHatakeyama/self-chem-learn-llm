The molecular structure indicates the presence of a bulky tert-butyl group attached to a benzene ring, which is also substituted with a hydroxyl group. This bulky structure contributes to the relatively high melting point of the compound. The melting temperature of 66.0 [oC] suggests that Butylated hydroxytoluene is a solid at room temperature. \n\nThe high melting point of Butylated hydroxytoluene can be attributed to the strong intermolecular forces between the molecules, particularly the London dispersion forces and hydrogen bonding. The bulky tert-butyl group creates a large surface area, allowing for increased London dispersion forces between molecules, while the hydroxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding with other molecules. These intermolecular forces require a significant amount of energy to overcome, resulting in a higher melting point. \n\nIn conclusion, the melting temperature of Butylated hydroxytoluene is 66.0 [oC], which is a result of its molecular structure and the resulting intermolecular forces.
