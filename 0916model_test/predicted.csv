The vapor pressure of a compound is the pressure exerted by a vapor in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases at a given temperature. To predict the vapor pressure of propane, we can use the Antoine equation, which is a mathematical relationship that describes the vapor pressure of a liquid as a function of temperature.

The Antoine equation is given by:

log10(P) = A - B / (T + C)

where:
- P is the vapor pressure of the liquid [kPa]
- T is the temperature [°C]
- A, B, and C are constants that depend on the specific compound

For propane, the Antoine constants are:
A = 4.5363
B = 1069.21
C = 237.22

Assuming a temperature of 20°C (293 K), we can plug these values into the Antoine equation to estimate the vapor pressure of propane.

log10(P) = 4.5363 - 1069.21 / (20 + 237.22)
log10(P) = 4.5363 - 1069.21 / 257.22
log10(P) = 4.5363 - 4.155
log10(P) = 0.3813

3. Determine the ionization energy: The ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from the molecule. We can estimate the ionization energy by using the following equation:

Ionization energy (eV) = (Number of valence electrons) / (Number of atoms)

Plugging in the values, we get:

Ionization energy (eV) = 40 / 5 = 8
