In the case of Thymine, its Absolute molar magnetic susceptibility is 50.0 [10^-6 cm3/mol], indicating a relatively weak magnetic response. This is consistent with the fact that Thymine is a non-magnetic compound, meaning it does not have unpaired electrons that can be magnetized. The value of 50.0 [10^-6 cm3/mol] suggests that Thymine is weakly diamagnetic, meaning it is weakly repelled by a magnetic field.
