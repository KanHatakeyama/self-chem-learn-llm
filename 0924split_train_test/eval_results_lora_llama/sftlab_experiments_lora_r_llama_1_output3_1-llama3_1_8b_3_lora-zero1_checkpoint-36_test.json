The addition of the acetyl group to the ferrocene core may also play a role in reducing the density of the molecule."

The SMILES notation indicates the molecular structure of the compound, which can be used to determine its physical properties. However, without a specific value for the density, we can only make an educated estimate based on general knowledge. Aminooxyacetic acid is a relatively small molecule, and its density is likely to be close to that of water, which is 1 g/cm3. However, the presence of the amine group and the carboxylic acid group may contribute to a slightly higher density. Based on this, a predicted density of 1.2 g/cm3 is a reasonable estimate."

The given compound's SMILES notation, CC(=CC(=O)NC)OP(=O)(OC)OC, suggests it is an organic compound with a complex molecular structure. The flash temperature of such compounds can vary widely depending on their molecular weight, functional groups, and intermolecular forces. However, without specific data on the compound's properties, we can only make an educated estimate based on general trends. In this case, the predicted flash temperature is -20.0 oC, which is relatively low, indicating that the compound may be highly volatile and potentially flammable."
