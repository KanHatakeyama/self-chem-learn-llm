The given compound's SMILES notation, CCC, represents a simple alkane with three carbon atoms. The ionization energy of such a compound can be predicted based on its molecular structure. In general, the ionization energy of alkanes is relatively low due to the weak intermolecular forces present in these molecules. However, the exact value can vary depending on the specific molecular structure and the number of carbon atoms. In this case, the predicted ionization energy of the compound CCC is 7.7 eV. This value is within the typical range for alkanes, indicating that it would require a moderate amount of energy to remove an electron from this molecule."

The given compound, Sodium bromate, has a SMILES notation of [Na+].[O-]Br(=O)=O, indicating it is composed of sodium, bromine, and oxygen. The absolute standard enthalpy of formation for Sodium bromate is -0.3 kJ/mol. This value suggests that the formation of Sodium bromate is slightly exothermic, meaning it releases a small amount of energy."
