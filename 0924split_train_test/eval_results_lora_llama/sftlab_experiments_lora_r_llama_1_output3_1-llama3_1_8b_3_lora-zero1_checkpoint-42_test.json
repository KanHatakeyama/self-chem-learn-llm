Typically, hydrocarbons with a molecular weight around 100-150 g/mol have viscosities in the range of 0.3-0.6 mPas.

This value is a result of the compound's molecular structure, which is represented by its SMILES notation. The SMILES notation provides a way to describe the arrangement of atoms and bonds in a molecule, and it can be used to predict various physical and chemical properties, including boiling temperature. In this case, the SMILES notation for Nisin is very complex, indicating a large and complex molecule with many functional groups. The boiling temperature of a compound is influenced by the strength of the intermolecular forces between molecules, which in turn depends on the molecular structure. The complex structure of Nisin suggests that it has strong intermolecular forces, resulting in a relatively high boiling temperature of 268.0 oC."

Unfortunately, the volume of Rotenone is not provided. \n\nHowever, we can use the SMILES notation to estimate the volume of the compound. The SMILES notation can be used to calculate the molecular volume using various software or online tools.
