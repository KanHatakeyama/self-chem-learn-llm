The given compound has a SMILES notation of CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)O, indicating it is an organic compound with a long hydrocarbon chain and a carboxyl group. The flash temperature of such compounds can vary widely depending on their molecular structure and intermolecular forces. However, based on the given SMILES, it appears to be a relatively large molecule, which often results in a lower flash temperature due to stronger intermolecular forces."

The density of a compound is typically determined by its molecular structure, which can be represented by its SMILES notation. However, without a specific value for the density of O-Dianisidine, we can look at the SMILES notation to make an educated guess. The SMILES notation suggests that O-Dianisidine is a relatively large molecule with a complex structure, which may indicate a higher density. However, without more information, we can only make a rough estimate."
