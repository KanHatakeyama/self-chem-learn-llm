This value can also be used to predict the behavior of the compound under different conditions, such as changes in pressure and temperature. The boiling point is a fundamental physical property that provides valuable information about the intermolecular forces and molecular structure of a compound. In the case of Trimethylsilyl iodide, the boiling point of 163.0 [oC] suggests that it has a relatively high degree of intermolecular forces, which may be due to the presence of the iodine atom and the trimethylsilyl group. This property can be useful in understanding the compound's behavior in various chemical reactions and processes. The boiling point of Trimethylsilyl iodide is an important characteristic that can be used to predict its behavior and potential applications.
