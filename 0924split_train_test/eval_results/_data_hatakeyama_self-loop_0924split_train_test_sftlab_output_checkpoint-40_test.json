In the case of Triethylsilane, the relatively weak intermolecular forces, likely due to the presence of non-polar ethyl groups, result in a low melting point. This property makes Triethylsilane useful in various applications where a low melting point is desired. \n\nFurther studies on the physical and chemical properties of Triethylsilane can provide more insights into its behavior and potential uses. However, the melting temperature of -78.1 [oC] provides a fundamental understanding of its physical state under standard conditions."

However, without further information about the compound's composition or molecular weight, it is difficult to provide a more detailed explanation for this density value. Further analysis or experimentation would be necessary to fully understand the properties of this compound. \n\nIt is worth noting that the given SMILES notation suggests the presence of sulfur and phosphorus atoms, which may contribute to the compound's density. However, without more information, it is challenging to make more specific predictions about its properties. Further research would be necessary to determine the compound's full range of properties and potential applications. \n\nIn conclusion, the density of the compound is 1.14 [g/cm3], but further analysis is required to fully understand the implications of this value and the compound's overall properties."
