In this case, the notation indicates the presence of boron and hydrogen atoms, which are the primary components of the compound. The boiling temperature is a physical property that is influenced by the intermolecular forces between the molecules, which in turn depend on the molecular structure. Therefore, the boiling temperature of the compound can be predicted based on its molecular structure, as represented by the SMILES notation."
